<title>Problem A - A new chess game</title>


<h1 align="CENTER">Problem A - A new chess game</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> You are working on a new chess computer game with an infinite
chessboard and only knights. Of course, you cannot have an infinite
chessboard because you don't have infinite RAM! But you can compute
the largest chessboard that you need since you know the current
location of the knights and how many moves they can do.</p><p>

The goal is to know the number of distinct chessboard cells that can
be visited by <i>n</i> knights after a given number of moves of each knight. You can
assume that two or more knights can be in the same cell at the same
time.</p><p>

We remind you that a knight can perform 8 different moves, as shown in
the picture below.</p><p>

<h2>Input</h2> 

<p>The first line indicates the number of knights (<i>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 30</i>). Then,
 <i>n</i> lines follow. Each line gives the position (x,y) of a knight
 in the chessboard as well as the number of moves <i>m</i> (<i>0 &lt;= m
 &lt;= 7</i>) that it is allowed to perform. You may assume that knights
never travel beyond coordinates -200 to 200.</p><p>

</p><hr>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>
For each test case, print the number of distint cells that can be
visited by the <i>n</i> knights.</p><p>
