<h1 align="CENTER"> Problem C - Zé Manel is setting up a computer network</h1>

<hr>


<h2> Problem</h2> 

Zé Manel is now working as a computer engineer. His first job is to set up a 
computer network in a company. The network topology must be a tree, that is, 
the highest level of the network consists of a <i>root</i> node, which is 
connected to a single or multiple nodes in the level below by a point-to-point 
link. These lower level nodes are also connected to a single or multiple nodes in the next 
level down and so on.<p>
 

In addition to the tree structure, there are some constraints that he must take into account:
</p><ol>
<li> In order to reduce costs, the amount of cable used should be the least possible.
</li><li> The maximum number of point-to-point
links from a node in the network is bounded by some value.
</li></ol>

Therefore, given the cost of adding a feasible point-to-point link to each pair of 
network nodes, Zé Manel has to design the network with the tree topology that minimizes 
the cost and such that the number of point-to-point links that can be establish from each node does not 
exceed a given number. <p>

</p><p>


</p><hr> <h2> Input</h2>

Each test case starts with the number of network nodes (<i>n</i>), the number of 
feasible point-to-point links (<i>m</i>) and  the maximum 
number of feasible point-to-point links for any node (<i>k</i>). 
Then, <i>m</i> lines follow.
Each line contains three integers: the first two correspond to the network nodes IDs
for which a point-to-point link can be established, and the third corresponds to the 
cost of establishing the link with cable. 
Note that your program cannot add a point-to-point link that is not considered to be 
feasible (for instance, breaking the tree structure or exceeding the bound on the 
number of allowed links). Also, any node can be the root.<p>


</p><hr>
<h2> Output</h2> 
Find the network as described above. In case there is no possibility of designing 
such network due to some constraint, the output should be "NO WAY!". Otherwise,
output the minimum cost.<p>
